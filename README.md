Installation
------------

To install `flask` for the backend framework, you'll need to install two
packages with `pip`:

```
$ sudo pip install Flask
$ sudo pip install flask-restful
```

Contributing
------------

Please don't contribute (yet)! This is a school project, so we unfortunately
can't accept any contributions until after the term is over. As soon as the
quarter ends, we plan to make this completely open source and we'll permit (and
encourage) community involvement.
